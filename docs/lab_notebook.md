### A4.12 Filter test tolerances (P4: Lina)          date: 2026-11-09
Scope:            the three filter tests in `tests/test_cpu_gpu_equivalence.py` (the preprocessing
                  tests are covered by P3). 1 gray level = 1/255 ≈ 0.004.
Measured so far:  checked with a NumPy re-implementation of each GPU function against
                  `src/filters_cpu.py` (no CUDA machine available yet).

Gaussian blur (every pixel within 0.02):
    Too loose. 0.02 is about 5 gray levels, while my blur differs from OpenCV by only 3e-7.
    A slightly wrong blur (wrong sigma, wrong border mode) could still pass. Some margin is
    needed because the GPU computes convolutions in lower precision (TF32), but about
    1 gray level (0.004) would be enough.

Median filter (at most 2% of pixels may differ by more than 1 gray level):
    The 1-gray-level allowance is necessary: the CPU version converts to uint8, which rounds
    every value down to a whole gray level, so it can never be more than 1 gray level away
    from an exact float result. But 2% (about 1,000 pixels of a 224x224 image) is too generous:
    my version had 0% of pixels beyond 1 gray level. A tiny margin for floating-point rounding
    is fair (e.g. 0.1%). Also, the test image is black at the borders, so a wrong padding
    mode (reflect instead of replicate) would still pass.

Contrast stretch (every pixel within 0.001):
    About right. 0.001 is a quarter of a gray level, so invisible, and my version differs by
    only 6e-8 because CPU and GPU compute the percentiles the same way (linear interpolation).
    It could be tightened slightly (e.g. 1e-4), but not much more: a tolerance too close to
    zero could fail a correct GPU version just because of floating-point rounding differences.

Green channel (no test):
    This is a problem: nothing would warn us if the function returned the wrong channel
    (e.g. t[:, 0:1], the red one). A test should check the shape (N,1,H,W), that the values
    equal the green channel t[:, 1], and that the result is a view (same memory, no copy).

GPU test run:     Colab, Tesla T4, Python 3.13.16, pytest 8.4.2
                  `python -m pytest tests/test_cpu_gpu_equivalence.py -k "gaussian or median or contrast" -v`
                  test_gaussian_filter_equivalence   PASSED
                  test_median_filter_equivalence     PASSED
                  test_contrast_stretch_equivalence  PASSED
                  3 passed, 6 deselected in 3.29s

### A4.13 Median filter: GPU vs CPU time per image across batch sizes (P4: Lina)   date: 2026-11-10
Question:             At which batch size (1, 8, 32, 64, 128) does the GPU median filter become
                      faster per image than the CPU (OpenCV) one, if ever?
Prediction:           At batch size 1 the GPU is slower than the CPU, because the fixed kernel
                      launch overhead dominates. As the batch grows, the GPU time per image drops
                      (the overhead is shared by more images) and goes below the CPU time at
                      about batch size 64. The CPU time per image stays roughly constant.
Command:              python benchmarks/sweep_median.py   (default: batch sizes 1 8 32 64 128,
                      5 repeats, 2 warm-up runs, CUDA synchronized around every timed run;
                      the batch is already on the GPU, so the host-to-device copy is excluded)
Result:               DRAFT run on Colab, Tesla T4 (official run: P1, RTX 3050). ms per image:
                        batch    CPU (OpenCV)   GPU (torch)
                          1         0.73           3.58
                          8         0.82           2.76
                         32         0.84           2.44
                         64         1.11           2.44
                        128         1.10           2.45
                      Colab's CPU is shared, so the CPU times are noisy.
Prediction vs result: I predicted the GPU would overtake the CPU at batch size 64, but the CPU
                      won at every batch size (about 2x faster at 128). The first part of the
                      prediction was right: the GPU time per image drops from 3.58 to 2.44 ms as
                      the launch overhead is shared by more images. But it becomes flat from
                      batch 32 on: the GPU is then fully busy and 2.44 ms is the cost of the work
                      itself, so bigger batches cannot help.
Explanation:          The two versions do not do the same amount of work. OpenCV's medianBlur is a
                      specialized algorithm tuned for 8-bit images that avoids sorting most values.
                      My GPU version uses general operations: F.unfold copies each pixel's 25
                      neighbours into memory (25x the input size, about 1.9 GB for 128 images),
                      then torch.median sorts those 25 values once for every pixel. The extra memory
                      traffic and generic sorting cost more than the GPU's parallelism gains.
Decision:             Do not use this GPU median filter as is (it is not used in training anyway).
                      To make it faster, fuse the steps into one custom kernel (e.g. Numba CUDA,
                      A4.11): each thread reads its 25 neighbours directly and sorts them in
                      registers, which removes the 25x copy. Tuning blocks / threads per block is a
                      secondary improvement. Re-run on P1's RTX 3050 for the official numbers.

### A4.14 Host-to-device copy: uint8 vs float32 batch (P4: Lina)   date: 2026-11-10
Question:             How long does copying one batch of images from CPU memory to the GPU take
                      as uint8 vs as float32? (Second part, how much of the GPU preprocessing
                      time is the copy, needs P3's preprocess_batch_gpu.)
Prediction:           uint8 should be about 4x faster to copy, because it has 4x fewer bytes to
                      move (1 byte per value instead of 4).
Command:              (to be filled after the run)
Result:               (to be filled after the run)
Prediction vs result: (to be filled after the run)
